<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there. I know you'd want to know what kind of a web dev you're dealing with before handing over any
  serious projects to a stranger so here's a sneak peek into who I am. I prefer Ben, which I find short and
  easy to the tongue, especially for you. Besides spending most of my day staring at and debugging code 
  (Haha!Life of a WebDev) I am a gym enthusiast and very much into sports. A huge Man United fan and Kansas City
  Chiefs fan. I am also a health fanatic and any research regarding the body and food, I am in!
</p>

<p>Character wise, my friend Maurice calls me serious and disciplined because I commit to what I set my mind
  to and always keep time. I am quite sure you would not have a problem with that. I also enjoy collaborating on 
  projects so I wouldn't mind contributing a few ideas here and there to whatever brilliant project you'd want me
  developing for you. 
</p>

<p>There's a bit of a peek into who I am and I am looking forward to us providing solutions for a better world.
  Cheers!
